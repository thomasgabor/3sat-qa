It is one of the cornerstones of complexity theory that solving NP-complete or even NP-hard decision problems is not efficiently possible (e.g., \cite{cook1971complexity,murty1987some}). Any NP-complete problem can also be cast as an optimisation problem, which allows for employing well-known optimisation algorithms to find approximate solutions -- typical methods include tabu search (see, e.g.,~\cite{glover2013tabu,gendreau1994tabu}) and simulated annealing (see, e.g.,~\cite{kirkpatrick1983optimization,chen1995chaotic}). Countless other efficient approximation methods, together with an elaborate taxonomy on approximation quality (how much does a given solution differ from a known global optimum?) and computational effort (how many time steps are required until an approximate solution that satisfies given quality goals is available?), have been devised (see, e.g.,~\cite{NPO-Compendium}).

Some problems, for instance knapsack, exhibit favourable properties when cast as an optimisation problem. The latter is a member of the complexity class FPTAS (fully polynomial-time approximation scheme), which means that a solution with distance \(1+\epsilon\) (of course, $\epsilon > 0$) from an optimal solution can be determined in polynomial time in both, input size \(n\) and \(1/\epsilon\)~\cite{chen1995chaotic}.

An intriguing connection that has received substantial attraction exists between (computational) NP-complete problems and the (physical) concept of phase transitions, as detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:preliminaries}. First investigations of the phenomenon have been performed by Kirkpatrick et al.~\cite{kirkpatrick1994critical}, TODO~\cite{TODO monasson1999determining} and TODO~\cite{TODO}; more recent investigations include~\cite{TODO, TODO, TODO}. Our work benefits from these insights by selecting the ``most interesting'', that is, computationally hardest scenarios as investigation target.

The idea of obtaining solutions for NPO (NP optimisation) problems by finding the energy ground state (or states) of a quantum mechanical system appeared around 1988~\cite{TODO: Originalpaper,albash2016adiabatic} in the context of efforts by Apolloni et al.~\cite{apolloni1989quantum,apolloni1988numerical} to solve combinatorial optimisation problems.  The idea of quantum annealing has been independently re-discovered multiple times~\cite{albash2016adiabatic,finnila1994quantum,amara1993global,kadowaki1998quantum}.

Quantum annealing techniques are usually applied to solving NP-complete or NP-hard decision problems, or optimisation problems from class NPO. Lucas~\cite{lucas2014ising} reviews how to formulate a set of key NP problems in the language of adiabatic quantum computing respectively quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation. In particular, problems of the types ``travelling salesman'' or ``binary satisfiability'' that are expected to have a major impact on practical computational applications if they can be solved advantageously on quantum annealers have undergone a considerable amount of research~\cite{heim2017designing,warren2017small,moylett2017quantum,strand2017zzz,benjamin2017measurement}.

Comparing the computational capabilities of classical and quantum computers
is an intriguing and complex task, since the deployed ressources are typically very dissimilar. For instance, the amount of instructions required
to execute a particular algorithm is one of the main measures of efficiency
or practicability on a classical machine, whereas the notion of a discrete
computational ``step'' is hard to define on a quantum annealing device.

Interest in quantum computing has therefor spawned definitions of new complexity classes (e.g., \cite{klauck2017complexity,morimae2017merlinization}), whose relations to traditional complexity classes have been and are still subject to ongoing research (see, e.g., \cite{bernstein1997quantum,marriott2005quantum}).

These questions hold regardless of any specific physical or conceptual implementation of quantum computing since they are known to be largely interchangeable in regards to their overall computational capabilities; see, for instance, Ref.~\cite{mcgeoch2014adiabatic} for a discussion on the
equivalence of gate-based and adiabatic quantum computing. Consequently,
our work focuses not on comparing quantum and classical aspects of solving particular problems, but concentrates on understanding peculiarities
of solving one particular problem (3-SAT, in our case) in-depth.

Formulating 3-SAT problems on a quantum annealing hardware has been previously considered~\cite{choi2011different,choi2010adiabatic,farhi2000quantum}, and we rely on the encoding techniques presented there. Van~\cite{van2001powerful} and Farhi~\cite{farhi2009quantum} have worked on analysing the complexity of solving general 3-SAT problems.
