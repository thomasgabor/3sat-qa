\section{Introduction}
%Following the great paper \cite{feld2018hybrid} we thought, let's do another one!
%\todo{0.5 Introduction}

The benefit of the technology of quantum computing is essentially connected to achieving quantum speedups. Or, phrased more generally, if quantum computing is to succeed, it needs to be faster or better or cheaper than classical computing hardware on at least one useful task.

Research in that area has cast an eye on the complexity class NP: It contains problems that are traditionally (and at the current state of knowledge regarding the P vs.\ NP problem) conjectured to produce instances too hard for classical computers to solve exactly and deterministically within practical time constraints.

However, the notion of computational complexity is built on classical
computation in the sense of using classical mechanics to describe and
perform automated computations. In particular, it is known that in this
model of computation, simulating quantum mechanical systems is hard. However, nature itself routinely ``executes'' quantum mechanics, leading to
speculations~\cite{feynman1981simulating} that quantum mechanics may
be exhibit greater computational powerful than classical physical theories
can provide.

In this work, we focus on the concrete technological platform of quantum annealing that is (unlike the generalised concept of \emph{quantum annealing}) not capable of executing general quantum mechanical computations, but is within current technological feasibility, and available to researchers outside the field of quantum hardware. The mechanism specializes in solving optimization problems, and can (as a trade-off) work larger amounts of qubits in a useful way than quantum mechanically complete platforms.

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of quantum annealing (or more specifically, a D-Wave 2000Q machine) on the canonical problem of the class NP, propositional logic satisfiability for 3-literal clauses (3SAT)~\cite{cook1971complexity}. As we note that there is still a remarkable gap between 3SAT instances that can be put on a current D-Wave chip and 3SAT instances that even remotely pose a challenge to classical solvers, there is little sense in comparing the quantum annealing method to classical algorithms in this case. Instead, we are interested in the scaling behavior with respect to problem difficulty. Or more precisely: We analyze if and to what extent quantum annealing's performance suffers under hard problem instances (like classical algorithms do).

We present a quick run-down of 3SAT and the phenomenon of phase transitions in Section~\ref{sec:preliminaries} and continue to discuss further related work in Section~\ref{sec:related-work}. In Section~\ref{sec:exp-setup} we describe our experimental setup and then present the corresponding results in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}. We conclude with Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
